# Predicting NBA Entry from NCAA Player Data

Project Details

Every year student-athletes make major decisions about what University to play basketball for that will best prepare them for the future. NBA teams invest an incredible amount of time & resources to make the best selection during the NBA Draft. In order to get a taste of what statistics may be important in making these decisions, I set out to build a Generalized Liner Model to predict the likelihood of an NCAA Division I Basketball player becoming an NBA player based on characteristics such as height, position, birthday, and basketball stats such as points per game, etc. 


## Tools & Resources

To conduct my analysis I utilized: 

1) A dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats#Seasons_Stats.csv) from Kaggle that had NBA player data from 1950 to the beginning of the 2017-2018 Season. 

2) BeautifulSoup to scrape NCAA player data from the RealGM.com (https://basketball.realgm.com/ncaa/stats)

3) Google Places API to map latitude & longitude to player hometowns

4) Tableau to visualize data to highlight/reveal important characteristics to use in my model

5) StatsModels library and Matplotlib to plot model
